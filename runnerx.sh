Resilient Elastic System "Mind" Priming for LLMs

Unlocking Dynamic Capabilities in Browser-Based AI Agents

Suggested Container/Repository Name: AI_elastic_system_resilience_priming

Dive into the core concepts powering the next generation of AI systems that don't just run, but adapt, heal, and orchestrate complex tasks directly within the browser. This repository presents a unique approach to 'priming' Artificial Intelligence models, especially those with limited context or complexity handling, by curating and ordering foundational technical and philosophical concepts vital for building resilient, dynamic, and incredibly flexible AI agents.

Getting Started

To set up the project and generate the knowledge monolith:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/essingen123/AI_elastic_system_resilience_priming.git
cd AI_elastic_system_resilience_priming


(If you used the main setup script (like this one) locally to create these files, you can skip the clone and cd steps and start from step 2 in your current directory).

Install Required Python Libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed (3.6+ recommended). Open your terminal and run:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Download and Parse Articles:
Run the Python script to fetch and parse the Wikipedia articles:

python runner.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This will create a parsed_articles directory containing the text content.

Generate the Knowledge Monolith:
Run the Python script to create the interactive HTML file:

python smart_monolith.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This will create the rendered_results directory containing smart_monolith.html.

View the Monolith:
Open the rendered_results/smart_monolith.html file in your web browser.

The Concept: Mind Priming for LLMs

The sequence in which knowledge is acquired profoundly shapes understanding. For AI, this 'priming' can influence how it interprets and applies subsequent information. This section unveils three strategically designed orderings of crucial Wikipedia articles. Each order is a tailored journey through concepts vital for developing AI systems that are not only functional but embody resilience and elasticity, particularly within the cutting-edge environment of browser-based containers. These orderings are presented with attention weights in mind, suggesting that concepts presented earlier may have a more significant initial impact, though a more nuanced bell curve of attention might apply.

Order 1: Priming from Philosophy and Methodology to Technical Practice

Effect: Ignite a pragmatic revolution in your development process. This order starts by embedding the powerful philosophies of prioritizing working solutions and methodologies for rapid iteration ('Worse is Better', RAD). It strategically positions subsequent technical articles on paradigms and flexibility as essential tools to manifest this mindset, guiding you to build fast, 'just working,' and elastic systems. Prepare to tackle problems like: Crafting a Minimum Viable Self-Healing Browser AI Agent built for relentless iteration.

Order 2: Priming from Core Technical Foundation to System Behavior

Effect: Forge a rock-solid technical foundation from the ground up. By leading with the absolute core enablers – the browser environment (WebAssembly) and direct AI communication protocols (Prompt Engineering, MCP) – this order equips you with the fundamental building blocks first. You'll then explore how to weave these capabilities into dynamic systems, understanding the 'what' and the 'how-to-start' before layering on complex design. Prepare to tackle problems like: Engineering a highly responsive Browser AI Agent by mastering WebAssembly and direct prompting techniques.

Obtaining Article Content

To facilitate working with the content of these articles locally, this repository provides two methods for obtaining the data and a script to generate a browsable HTML monolith.

Method 1: Download Raw HTML using a Bash Script (download_articles.sh)

This script downloads the raw HTML content of the Wikipedia pages using the wget command-line utility into the raw_articles directory.

./download_articles.sh
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Method 2: Download and Parse to Text using a Python Script (runner.py)

This script fetches the Wikipedia pages, parses the HTML to extract the main article text, and saves the clean text content to .txt files in the parsed_articles directory.

python runner.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Method 3: Generate a Smart Monolith HTML File (smart_monolith.py)

This script reads the parsed text files from parsed_articles and generates a single, self-contained HTML file (smart_monolith.html) in the rendered_results directory. This HTML file presents the article content interactively, allowing you to toggle the visibility of each article.

python smart_monolith.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Usage of Obtained Content: Fueling Your AI and Development

Unlock the potential of this curated knowledge. The obtained article content (either raw HTML or parsed text) provides a powerful corpus you can leverage for a variety of advanced applications:

AI Training & Fine-tuning: Use the text to provide specialized context or fine-tune LLMs on the principles of resilient, dynamic systems.

Directory to save the parsed content

parsed_articles_dir = "parsed_articles"

--- Setup ---
Create the output directory if it doesn't exist

if not os.path.exists(parsed_articles_dir):
os.makedirs(parsed_articles_dir)
print(f"Created directory: '{parsed_articles_dir}'")

print(f"Starting to parse {len(wikipedia_urls)} articles...")

for url in wikipedia_urls:

# Fetch the page content using the requests library
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception for bad status codes (like 404 or 500)

    # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # --- Extracting Main Article Text ---
    # Wikipedia's main content is typically within a div with the id 'mw-content-text'.
    # Within that, the actual article paragraphs are usually <p> tags.
    # This approach tries to get all text from paragraphs in the main content area,
    # which usually avoids most headers, footers, and sidebars.
    main_content_div = soup.find(id='mw-content-text')

    if main_content_div:
        # Find all paragraph tags within the main content
        article_paragraphs = main_content_div.find_all('p')

        # Join the text of these paragraphs
        # We strip whitespace and use a newline as a separator between paragraphs
        article_text = "\n".join([p.get_text(strip=True) for p in article_paragraphs if p.get_text(strip=True)]) # Ensure empty paragraphs are not just newlines

        # --- Saving to File ---
        # Get a clean filename from the URL (e.g., "Worse_is_better.txt")
        # We take the last part of the URL path and add .txt
        title = url.split("/")[-1].replace('(','_').replace(')','') # Sanitize for filenames
        filename = os.path.join(parsed_articles_dir, f"{title}.txt")

        # Save the extracted text to a file with UTF-8 encoding
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:

exit()

Get a list of all text files in the parsed articles directory
We want to maintain the order from runner.py if possible, so we try to read them in a specific order if defined
For now, glob does not guarantee order, but for this specific set, it might be alphabetical by filename
A more robust way would be to re-use the URL list from runner.py to define order.
However, runner.py saves files like "Worse_is_better.txt", "Rapid_application_development.txt" etc.
Let's use the same list of URLs as runner.py to determine the order of files.
(This assumes runner.py has been run and created files based on this order)
This list should ideally be shared or imported, but for simplicity, we redefine it here.
It must match the order and naming convention from runner.py (URL basename as filename)
